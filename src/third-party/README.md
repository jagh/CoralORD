# Third-Party Libraries

This folder contains third-party libraries that can be used in the CoralORD solution. Each library should have its own subdirectory with a README file explaining its purpose and usage.

To use a library's functions in the CoralORD solution, follow these steps:

1. Copy the library's files into the appropriate subdirectory in this folder.
2. Update the project's build configuration to include the library's source files.
3. Import the necessary headers or modules in your code.
4. Use the library's functions as needed.

Please refer to the individual library's documentation for specific instructions on how to integrate and use it in your project.
